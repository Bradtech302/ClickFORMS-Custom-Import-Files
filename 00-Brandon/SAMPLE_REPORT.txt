The subject neighborhood's boundaries are as follows: NORTH by Westwood st., SOUTH by Redwood park, EAST by University Ave., and West by Iaguna lake.
Mountain Ranch is ten miles E of San Andreas which is the County Governmental Center. It is a semi rural/suburban location in the Sierra Mountains. The housing stock is a mix of both newer & older homes on small to larger acreage parcels. Dwellings vary in size & style.  Market demand is moderate for this area because of its quiet atmosphere & moderate driving times to major Cities.
During the lifetime of the Erasure Bechet community, the market for this area has been in demand much higher than the supply. Market conditions are presently considered, because this area is a high demand area. Marketing periods generally range from 1-3 months. Properties financed within the subject market area are typically financed with 25% down on principal. The high tech industry continues to boom in silicon valley and thus the need for high class housing within driving distance to industrial areas is in high demand.
